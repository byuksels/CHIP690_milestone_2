# Analysis of Reportable Hazardous Ingredients in California Cosmetic Products

## Project Overview:
It is well established that certain ingredients and chemicals used in cosmetic products may cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive or developmental harm. Some U.S. states require companies to report these ingredients, and California is one of them. Under the California Safe Cosmetics Act, any manufacturer, packer, or distributor listed on a cosmetic product sold in California must report to the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) if the product contains ingredients known or suspected to be harmful to human health.
In this project, dataset from California Department of Public Health’s California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) will be used to examine the reported chemical ingredients, the types of products they appear in, and the companies that use them.

## Research Question:
Which five reportable ingredients are used most frequently, in which product categories they appear most often, and which companies use them the most?

## Data Source:
This dataset comes from the California Department of Public Health’s California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) and contains information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients found in cosmetic products sold in California.

## Objective:
This milestone project involved using Python to analyze and visualize data in support of a defined research question. The deliverable was a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrated data acquisition and cleaning, analytical methods, and data visualization. 

## Analysis and Visualization:
Using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib, data was explored through:
* Bar Chart (to visualize the occurence of top 5 chemicals) 
* Pie Chart (to visualize the top 5 chemical usage in product categories and companies)


## Key Findings:
* Titanium dioxide was the most frequently reported ingredient, appearing in approximately 81% of products, far exceeding all other chemicals analyzed.
* Use of these ingredients spans a wide range of product categories, with over half of reported cases falling into “other product categories,” indicating broad distribution across cosmetic types.
* Lip products and eye makeup consistently appear among the top categories for multiple chemicals, making color cosmetics a major source of reported ingredient usage.
* Ingredient usage is concentrated among a few large companies, but the majority of reports come from hundreds of other manufacturers, suggesting widespread industry use rather than concentration within a small number of brands.
